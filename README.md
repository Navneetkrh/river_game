# River Game Project

This project is a simple game built with Python. Below are instructions on how to set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

     ```sh
     python -m venv venv
     ```
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On **Windows**:

     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:

     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Install Dependencies**

   - Once the virtual environment is activated, install all required dependencies using:

     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
4. **Running the Game**

   - After installing the dependencies, run the game using your chosen method (e.g., running a main Python file).

## Project Structure

- `requirements.txt`: Contains a list of Python packages required for the project.
- `README.md`: Provides project setup instructions and details.
